                        Three years after he made his feature-film debut with a surprisingly good Evil Dead reboot, filmmaker Fede Alvarez directed and co-wrote his own gripping, original addition to the horror canon. A trio of teens attempt to rob the house of a blind man. It’s only then they learn about their target’s past: He’s is a bereft Army vet (Avatar‘s Stephen Lang) whose daughter has died and, to cope with his lost, has subsequently taken some dark turns in his life. Tables get turned, and predators become prey – it’s abject, twisted and totally compelling. KG

                        Desperate for a hit, a true-crime author (Ethan Hawke) takes on a project involving a serial killer; coming across a box of Super-8 films in the basement, he discovers that the house he’s staying in may help him with his research in the worst possible ways. This return to the good ol’ hard-R horror trend after a long line of anodyne mid-‘aughts thrillers felt like a sucker-punch to the abdomen, working a gruesome legacy of snuff films, occult nastiness and literary vanity to incredible scary-movie effect.

                        The first Saw, released only a year earlier, was a hit with a branding-ready bad guy called Jigsaw, so a sequel was all but inevitable. Fortuitously, screenwriter Darren Lynn Bousman had been attempting to shop around a script called The Desperate that was close enough to the 2004 movie that the franchise could easily repurpose it – and in the process, make a far better film than the original. Stronger characters, a greater sense of panic, that stark giallo-inspired look and Donnie Wahlberg losing his shit while his son struggle with one of the killer’s games – this was a superior Saw in every imaginable way. It was such a hit Bousman directed the next two sequels.

                        If you took the best parts of your pals and put them together, you could make the perfect friend, right? That’s literally what the titular character of May attempts to do to cure her crushing loneliness. Angela Bettis channels her heroine’s inner Carrie White, evoking empathy as her character’s metal state deteriorates. With each rejection, the audience becomes more complicit in her craziness as May kills and dismembers people in an attempt to achieve the impossible: finding someone to have and to hold. Mad props to director Lucky McKee for creating a character so relatable that we want nothing more than for her to succeed. JV

                        Sheriff Deputy Rick Grimes wakes up from a coma to learn the world is in ruins and must lead a group of survivors to stay alive.Cartel-related violence has turned a Mexican city into a virtual ghost town; overnight, a young girl named Estrella (Paola Lora) finds herself orphaned when her mother “disappears.” Out of desperation, she falls in with a roving band of similarly homeless kids, led by a boy named Shine (Juan Ramón López). A stolen cellphone has put all of them in the narco gang’s crosshairs. Luckily, Estrella has spirits of the dead on her side, all of whom would like a word with the men who killed them. Writer-director Issa López’s supernaturally tinged survival tale has attracted its share of attention (Guillermo del Toro is one of its biggest fans and most vocal advocates). It’s an absolutely brilliant, heartbreaking example of how to use horror in the service of chills and social commentary without slighting either.
