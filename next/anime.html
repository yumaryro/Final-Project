                        One Piece is a great anime that you can easily become obsessed with! The show starts off with the Pirate King revealing the existance of One Piece, the treasure that will give its owner an unlimited amount of riches and fame. He reveals that before his execution. The anime follows Monkey D. Luffy, a teenage boy who forms his crew and travels across the Grand Line, battles strong enemies, and experiences different adventures in order to reach the greatest treasure. You will fall in love with each and every member of LuffyÂ´s crew. All these characters are well developed and unique with their different and fun personalities. The beginning mostly spends time introducing the characters, though you will always find some action in these episodes. However, once the formed crew reaches their destination, you will dive into endless adventure!

                        Pokemon is considered to be one of the most popular anime series out there. This show is fun and has adventure, action, and morals. Since the show is aimed primarily at kids, it teaches them many moral lessons. The road trip stories never take place in one town, so you won't be annoyed. Give this cute show a try, especially if you have experienced this franchise in other mediums such as games or cards.

                        You will love the degree of emotions in this show. There are so many heart-wrenching moments that it will make you really worry about the characters or even cry a river! There are so many reasons to love this vastly popular anime series! First of all, it has character development. Everyone in the series has their dark past which binds the viewer to the story. We can't deny the fact that even antagonists in this show are likeable because they each have their own justified reasons. There are so many lovable, smart, and righteous characters! Another thing that makes Naruto so special is a deeply developed jutsu structure; each character is not simply overloaded with powers. They have their own unique fighting style. This complexity is one of the things that makes the series different from others.

                        If you are looking for comedy, romance, dramatic moments, and a great soundtrack, Sailor Moon should be your choice. The romance and comedy here are well balanced with some funny moments and it works well! The characters here are so easy to relate to! They are cute, lovable, and relatable in many ways. This show may seem childish (primarily because of the voices in dubbed version), but it actually covers a lot of issues such as sexuality, violence, and many relationship problems. Many fans of this anime series say that it's better to avoid the English dubbed version. They recommend that you watch it with subtitles because the voice acting is way better in the original Japanese version.

                        Fullmetal Alchemist tells the story of two brothers who make an attempt to bring their mother back to life. According to the fundamental law of alchemy, in order to get something, an alchemist must sacrifice something of the same value. Thus, one of the brothers loses an arm and the other loses his entire body (his soul becomes bonded into a suit of armor). Soon, the brothers learn about the existence of the Philosopher Stone, which has the ability to transcend the laws of alchemy. Our heroes decide to embark on a quest to get that stone. The further they go, the more they realize they are drawn into a far darker battle than they imagined.
